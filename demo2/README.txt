**The Game**

**RULES**
The rules of the game are similar to that of a normal Tic-Tac-Toe.
The first person to create a continuous line of three wins.
The few difference between 3D and the 2D version are that:
-> Making surface diagonals does not count as a win.
-> Diagonals passing from an edge to the opposite edge through center does not count as a win
-> Diagonals passing from a corner to opposite corner(Major diagonals) through the center counts as a win.

The game finishes when either of the player wins or the game results in draw.
When this condition is met, a gameover window will appear.
On clicking the result button, the status of the game can be viewed.
